# Oh god

What have I done

Made with [`gum`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) and some definitely-not-fit-for-purpose bash

## Instructions
> Implying you're that much of a sucker for punishment

1. Get [`gum`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) somehow
2. Ensure [`gum`](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) is in your `$PATH`
3. Probably some extras about making sure you can run `vboxmanage` as your current user ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
4. [`./vb.sh`](vb.sh)
5. Please don't burn my house down
