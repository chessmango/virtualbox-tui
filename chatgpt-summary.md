This bash script is a text user interface (TUI) for managing virtual machines (VMs) using Oracle's VirtualBox software. The script uses a series of functions to present a list of options to the user and perform actions on VMs based on the user's selection.

The `main_header` function displays the title of the TUI, and the `vm_header` function shows information about the selected VM, including its current state. The `separator_header` function outputs a separator line to visually break up the output.

The `list_vms` function is the entry point for the script. It displays a list of available VMs for the user to choose from, or a message if no VMs are found. The selected VM's UUID is extracted from the list and passed to the `stat_vm` function.

The `stat_vm` function shows information about the selected VM and calls the `list_actions` function, which presents a list of actions that can be performed on the selected VM. Depending on the user's selection, the script will call other functions to handle the specific action. For example, if the user selects "Start", the `list_start_options` function is called to provide options for how the VM should be started.

The script also includes functions for pausing and resuming a VM, rebooting a VM, stopping a VM, and managing a VM's settings. When an action is completed, the script returns to the `list_vms` function to allow the user to select another VM or perform another action.
